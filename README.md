# What are Kanban boards?
The term" Kanban" originates from Japanese language and can be roughly restated as" billboard" or "signboard". It generally consists of columns representing different stages of work. Each column contains cards representing individual tasks. As you work on a task, you move its card from the left column to the right as it gets near to completion. This helps you see where your work is and how it's moving on . This visualization tool helps you to optimize the inflow of your work.
Functionality:
Tasks: Each column will have cards that represent tasks for different  stages, such as "To-Do," "Doing," and "Done" .
Moving Tasks: To show progress, you can move tasks from one column to another. For example, when you start working on a task, move it from "To-Do" to "Doing."
Interactive Features: JavaScript is used to make the tasks interactive. You can click and drag them from one column to another, just like moving digital sticky notes.
Automatic Sizing: The columns are smart they adjust their size to fit the tasks. So, if you have lots of tasks in one column, it won't look messy.
